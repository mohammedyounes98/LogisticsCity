# Description of the Chair

New concepts, new urban logistics companies are emerging in Asia, Europe and the United States, and more recently in all urban regions of the world, driven by digital revolutions. This logistics aims to meet the demand of urban businesses and consumers for new services while providing solutions to cities' concerns about the environmental and social impacts of current urban deliveries.

For cities with efficient urban logistics (like Tokyo) which integrate logistics equipment in very dense urban areas or "smart" neighborhood logistics, there are still many less central districts and many large cities in the world whose congestion and emissions linked to the transport of goods remain at far too high levels, while social issues (jobs and working conditions) become more acute.

The Logistics City Chair fits into this context, with a dual specific ambition:

-   Pay particular attention, particularly through the disciplines of town planning and development, to the issue of warehouses as crucial logistical locations for urban and metropolitan environments.

-   Explore the impact on urban logistics and territories of new consumption and distribution trends, particularly those linked to e-commerce and more generally to digital transformations. We will work in the Ile-de-France region, from a very comparative perspective by collecting data and identifying developments in other major world cities.

We aim to increase knowledge while ensuring that we provide methodological tools to public and private actors in urban logistics, in order to contribute to the development of public policies relating to the mobility of goods, the energy transition of the sector, the new logistics real estate and employment.
